This repository represents my work in LINGUIST 245B: Methods in Psycholinguistics, taken Spring Quarter 2025 at during my junior year at Stanford University!

This study aimed to replicate the first task in Kutlu et al.'s 2022 study analyzing the impact of race on speech perception and accentedness judgment in racially diverse and non-diverse groups. Following the documented methods and using available materials from the original study, participants were recruited via Prolific to complete a one hour long experiment involving a language background questionnaire, a LexTALE language dominance task, and a social networks questionnaire prior to a speech intelligibility task. Three varieties of English (American, British, Indian) were paired in random order with either one of two Caucasian female faces or a South Asian female face. The study was motivated by the research question, how does race impact speech perception and social judgment of spoken English, and is there a difference in this impact depending on the racial diversity of one's social network?

The finding of interest from the original study was that participants reported lower intelligibility ratings for all varieties when speech was paired with South Asian faces. There was an additional finding that participants who reported less racially diverse social networks had higher accentedness judgment ratings than those with more racially diverse social networks; however, given the scope of the project and the length of the experiment task, I plan to focus on the first finding.
